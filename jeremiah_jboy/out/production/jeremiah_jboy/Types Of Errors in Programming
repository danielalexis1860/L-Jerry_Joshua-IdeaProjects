Types Of Errors in programming include:
1). Logical Errors:
       This is error due to giving the code another function differently from what you wanted it to do.
   The code runs and gives output but not the output you wanted it to give.
   EXAMPLE:
   You want to add
   X + Y
   and you give or assign X as 30 and Y as 20, which will give 50  because 30 + 20 is equal to 50.
   but you now do
   X * Y when you run it will give you 600 Which is 30 *20

2).  Semantic Errors:
        This is due to wrong spelling etc..

3).  Syntax Errors:
        This is due to wrong use in language of program.
